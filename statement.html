<h1>Me</h1>

<p><i>Me</i> follows the development of an unknown protagonist in their journey to establishing healthy relationship boundaries. Viewers are thrown into the world of the protagonist with little background information about the protagonist, the people they are conversing with, and the environment they exist in. There are obstacles and challenges that the viewer needs to overcome to re-establish their needs and identity as individuals. The first page tries to depict the one-sided nature of a child who converses with their toxic parent. The answers are all "yea's" because they have learned that saying anything else will offer them punishment. By clicking the real thoughts that the child has, the viewer is taken to page two where the guilt trips happen. Viewers are tricked to click on the big "Maybe I am the problem." As this is usually how kids respond to long term emotional abuse. But this only takes the viewers to a dark place with no solution and they come back to the page again. It is after where viewers look closely and find the "No, my perspective matters too." Where they can get to the ending. Children who grow up in narcissistic families are often disoriented and do not know why things are happening, who is right or wrong, if their feelings or opinions are valid, and what may happen next. The whole experience is fragmented in many ways including dialogue and takes time to process as if it is a recall of events that happened to someone in the past. Ultimately <i>Me</i> gives insight into those who grow up "Unseen" in the context of toxic families. Emotional toxicity is also not always apparent at first which makes it extra hard to navigate through.
